# My Project is called "   "

# Welcome to my first game application
## Write a paragraph or two providing an syopsis of your project.(Sell your game!!)

STRATEGY

What are you aiming to achieve

What's worth doing - Focus
What are we creating - definition
What value does it provide - value.

This application has been designed to provide an enjoyable 
game experience in matching

for whom??

Is the content culturally appropriate.
Is it for schools.

Is the content relevent?
Is it appropriate for your intended audience

Interviews
Do a competitor review
Pros and cons
What's missing
Would you use this
Why
What do you like about this product
What changes could I make



This application is designed for children.

Beware of scope creep. Try to stick to the plan. Don't keep adding on - maybe
leave it for an addition or special feature at a later stage.
Task : functional specification - refine the information
Outcome: A function plan to display all elements of the website and how they link together.

List all the features of your project

SKELETON PLANE

How will are information be represented and how will the user navigate to the
information and features.

What has priority - what will get the most space.  What will be on the opening page.

Task : interface design, navigation design and information design
Outcome: developing paper-based prototypes or tool based prototypes

Interface design will decide on the best arrangement and visual presentation of elements.
Navigation design will take into concern intuitive navigation and the completion
of tasks.

Include mock - ups (Balsamique)

Never rely on the browser forward and back functions always add prev or next
buttons for example or arrows

SURFACE PLANE

What will the finished project look like.
Colors

Insert a table of colors used with rgba values and why you chose them

Use the same colors throughout the project.

Keep the header and footer the same across all pages.



typography

Talk about the font used, where it came from and why you chose it.

What other design elements will you use.

Effects


Imagery


minimise cognitive overload and maximise intuitive learning.

format of page - balance

1/3  : 2/3

footer information - three sections 


Task : what can the user do, what can they click, where can they go, how can 
interact with the site.
Outcome: the final version of what appears on the screen.












## UX - user experience   useful, useable and valuable.  

Who is this website for?
What do your users want to achieve?
How will my project best fit the needs of the user?

e.g. As a user I want to be able to ... play this game... so that I can ...get the highest score...

You should share a link to your wireframe here.  (AmIResponsive)(Balsamique) 
Include as a pdf in the project itself (images section)

## UI - user interface

### Project goals 
### User goals
### User stories - needs and wants of your target audience
### Look of your site
### Use your stories for the testing section of your README


## Wireframes


## Features

The parts of your project - describe each part in a paragraph.

Existing Features-each feature could be linked to a specific project file that 
demonstrates the feature.  e.g. link to index.html

* Feature 1 home page.
allows the user to sign up/play game/select level

List all features of your web application.

Features left to implement

Here you could mention any features you would like to add to your app in the future.


Technologies Used.

Mention all the languages, framewords, libraries and any other tools that you have used to construct this project.
For each one provide 

Name and a link to its official site and a short sentence to demonstrate what you used if for.

e.g. html  for writing html pags
css - for styling 
JavaScript - for interactive design
JQuery - This project uses JQuery to reduce the code used for DOM manipulation.

mention any bugs or problems that appeared during your testing.

you can provide a separate section for your TESTING if you like.
